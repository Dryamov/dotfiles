# Executes custom command for swaynag. Default is swaynag. Additional arguments may be 
# appended to the end. This should only be used to either direct sway to call swaynag 
# from a custom path or to provide additional arguments. 
# This should be placed at the top of the config for the best results.
# It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: swaynag_command -
  # nag
    # nag
  set {
    $nag         exec swaynagmode
    $nag_exit    $nag --exit
    $nag_confirm $nag --confirm
    $nag_select  $nag --select
  }
  mode "nag" {
    bindsym {
      Ctrl+d    mode "default"

      Ctrl+c    $nag_exit
      q         $nag_exit
      Escape    $nag_exit

      Return    $nag_confirm

      Tab       $nag_select prev
      Shift+Tab $nag_select next

      Left      $nag_select next
      Right     $nag_select prev

      Up        $nag_select next
      Down      $nag_select prev
    }
  }
  

  # -R is recommended for swaynag_command so that, upon a syntax error in your sway config, the
  # 'Reload Sway' option will be initially selected instead of the 'Exit Sway' option
