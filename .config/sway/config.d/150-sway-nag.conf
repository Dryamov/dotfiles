# Executes custom command for swaynag. Default is swaynag. Additional arguments may be 
# appended to the end. This should only be used to either direct sway to call swaynag 
# from a custom path or to provide additional arguments. 
# This should be placed at the top of the config for the best results.
# It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: swaynag_command -
# swaynag_command disable
